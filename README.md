# Discrete Math at SPbSU

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alexanderskulikov/discrete-math/master)

A collection of interactive notebooks for the 
Discrete Math course at SPbSU 
(click the badge above to launch the interactive environment). 
The interactive notebooks complement live lecture by providing 
visualizations and additional resources, but are not meant to 
replace the lectures (in particular, contain almost no proofs).

## Program

1. **Induction (September 5, 2018)**
TBW

TBW
4. **Graphs (September 26, 2018)**
* Handshaking lemma, total degree formula.
* Knights transposition: board cell graph, configuration graph.
* Eulerian cycles: bridges of KoÌˆnigsberg, criterion for undirected and directed graphs.
* Hamiltonian cycles: no known simple criterion.
* Genome assembly: shortest common superstring problem, reduction to the Hamiltonian path problem,
special case: $k$-spectrum of an unknown string, reduction to Eulerian path problem, de Bruijn graphs.
