# Discrete Math at SPbSU

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alexanderskulikov/discrete-math/master)

A collection of interactive notebooks for the 
Discrete Math course at SPbSU 
(click the badge above to launch the interactive environment). 
The interactive notebooks complement live lecture by providing 
visualizations and additional resources, but are not meant to 
replace the lectures (in particular, contain almost no proofs).
