# Discrete Math at SPbSU

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alexanderskulikov/discrete-math/master)

A collection of interactive notebooks for the 
Discrete Math course at SPbSU 
(click the badge above to launch the interactive environment). 
The interactive notebooks complement live lecture by providing 
visualizations and additional resources, but are not meant to 
replace the lectures (in particular, contain almost no proofs).

## Program

1. **Induction (September 5, 2018)**
* Warm-up: coloring the plane, arithmetic series, sum of squares, change problem, triangualtion.
* Bernoulli's inequality.
* Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means.
* Systems of homogeneous linear equations.
* Gray code.
* Hall's theorem.

2. **Combinatorics (September 12, 2018)**
* Sum rule, inclusion-exclusion formula.
* Receurrence relations, Fibonacci numbers, number of paths on a grid.
* Product rule, tuples.
* Permutations.
* Combinations, Pascal's triangle, symmetries.
* Binomial theorem.

3. **Catalan numbers (September 19, 2018)**
TBW

4. **Graphs I (September 26, 2018)**
* Handshaking lemma, total degree formula.
* Knights transposition: board cell graph, configuration graph.
* Eulerian cycles: bridges of KoÌˆnigsberg, criterion for undirected and directed graphs.
* Hamiltonian cycles: no known simple criterion.
* Genome assembly: shortest common superstring problem, reduction to the Hamiltonian path problem,
special case: k-spectrum of an unknown string, reduction to Eulerian path problem, de Bruijn graphs.

5. **Graphs II (October 3, 2018)**
* Connected components in undirected graphs: lower bound, the heaviest stone problem.
* Trees: four definitions, their equivalence.
* Bipartite graphs: 2-coloring, odd cycles, Hall's theorem.
* Ramsey numbers: R(3,3)=6, general upper bound.
* Directed acyclic graphs and topological ordering.
* Strongly connected components in directed graphs: metagraph, 2-satisfiability.
